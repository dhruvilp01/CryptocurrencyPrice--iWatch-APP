# Apple Watch - Cryptocurrency (Bit Coin)

## BITCOIN App + Complications.


	This app will update the price for the BitCoin
	I had also added the Complication in this - Small and Large.
	Everytime you open the App it will update the price of the Bitcoin along with the last price you can see.
	In the complication you have to manually add the cryptocurrency app in the small icon as well as you can add in the large to check more in detail.

## Installation...

	Download the App.
	Open the app in Xcode and cheange the bundle Identifier with your unique name.
	Connect your iPhone with the MAC and also your iWatch with your iPhone.
	Run the project.
	Enjoy it.

Thank you.
